    <p>
      These <em>blueberry muffins</em> are quick and easy with a moist and
      tender center bursting with blueberries and perfectly golden brown top.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh or frozen blueberries</strong> work in this recipe. It’s
        tricky to find sweet fresh blueberries all year round. Thankfully, this
        doesn’t prevent us from getting our blueberry muffin fix! When using
        frozen blueberries, add them when they are still frozen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>We use all-purpose flour</strong>, but you can use 100% whole
        wheat flour or a combination of whole wheat and all-purpose flour. A
        gluten-free flour blend also works. Just keep in mind that changing the
        flour from all-purpose will affect the texture of the muffins slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Granulated sugar</strong> helps to make the blueberry muffins
        flavorful and tender. You can swap for other sugars (brown sugar or
        coconut sugar, for example), but the texture of the bread will change
        slightly. I also love adding a sprinkle of sugar to the muffin tops just
        before baking, which turns into a crackly top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil</strong> is my favorite fat to use when making these
        blueberry muffins. I usually use butter when baking since I love the
        flavor, but after testing these muffins with both oil and butter, we
        found that the oil made more tender muffins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Milk</strong> is my go-to liquid for baking muffins, but if you
        are dairy-free, try homemade oat milk, unsweetened almond milk or
        coconut milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg</strong> provides structure and stability to the muffins. We
        use one egg. If you do not eat eggs, you can try using a flax egg
        instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder</strong> is our go-to leavener for these blueberry
        muffins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt and vanilla</strong> extract add flavor to the bread and
        make them taste amazing.
      </li>
    </ul>
