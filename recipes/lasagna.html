    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet,
      traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese),
      Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the
      traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different
      recipes over the years.
